# lazynav by jotesoft for windows only
Lazy nav is simple gui to controll your smartphone via usb or wirelessly.or you can use it as a virtula navigation bar with any app like Scrcpy.orginally i created this simple gui so that i can navigate Scrcpy screen copy mirroring on my pc using mouse and keyboard and decide to build a standalone app for it.

instraction:
-download the file lazynav_windows.zip
-extract the file
-enjoy

note: usb debugger must turnd on in the developer setting of your phone. 
you can use onscreen buttons or use keyboard shortcut.

keybord shortcut :
up = swipe up, 
down = swipe down, 
left = swipe left, 
right = swipe right, 
b = back, 
H = home, 
m = menu, 


Full mouse and keybord implementation as well as navigavion wireless via wifi is plan to add later. if you are using scrcpy you cann use this app wirelessly.
