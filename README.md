# lazynav
Lazy nav is simple gui to controll your smartphone or use as it as a virtula navigation bar for any app. orginally i created this simple gui so that i can navigate Scrcpy screen copy mirroring on my pc using mouse and keyboard and decide to build a standalone app for it.

you can use on screen button or use 

keybord shortcut :
up = swipe up
down = swipe down
left = swipe left
right = swipe right
b = back 
H = home
m = menu 


full mouse and keybord implementation is plan to update later.
